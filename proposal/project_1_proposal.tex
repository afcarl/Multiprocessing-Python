\section{Proposal}
For my MSAN 610 Project 1 presentation, I would discuss the theory related to and one implementation of \href{https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.pool.multiprocessing.Pool.map}{Pool Mapping in Python} (multithreaded mapping using a built in Python module). In particular, I my presentation would aim to inform the audience of the use cases, benefits and detriments of Pool Mapping.

\subsection{Theory}
For the theory section of my presentation, I will briefly discuss how mapping works, as well as a very brief discussion of how multiprocessing works. Additionally, I will mention the speed improvements and overhead detriments associated with using a Pool map. 

Additionally, I will $not$ discuss the need for multiprocessing in lieu of multithreading in Python, nor the Global Interpreter Lock in Python.

\subsection{Implementation}
For the implementation section, I will provide code snippets (to be available digitally on my GitHub), and possibly a live demo which highlights the speed-ups provided by using multiprocessing. The code I will provide will be designed to quickly replace the built in map or list comprehension.
